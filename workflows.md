- Security vulnerabilities will be listed in the npm audit report

## 2. Deployment Pipeline (deploy.yml)

### Purpose
Automates the deployment process to GitHub Pages.

### Configuration
- Triggers: Push to main branch, Manual trigger
- Steps:
  - Build project
  - Run tests
  - Deploy to GitHub Pages
  - Send deployment notifications

### Interpreting Results
- Deployment status will be available in the Actions tab

### Purpose
Automates dependency management using Dependabot.

### Configuration
- Schedule: Weekly on Monday at 00:00 UTC
- Steps:
  - Check for updates
  - Run tests on updates
  - Auto-approve secure updates

### Interpreting Results
- View Dependabot PRs in the Pull Requests tab

- View SonarCloud quality metrics
- Monitor code coverage reports

## 6. Documentation Deployment (documentation.yml)

### Purpose
Automates the build and deployment of project documentation.

### Configuration
- Triggers: Push to main branch (docs/** or **.md), Manual trigger
- Steps:
  - Build documentation using docsify
  - Deploy to GitHub Pages
  - Verify deployment

### Interpreting Results
- Check deployment status in Actions tab

## Required Secrets

The following secrets need to be configured in your repository:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatically provided)
- `SONAR_TOKEN` (for SonarCloud integration)
- `NPM_TOKEN` (for publishing packages)

## Best Practices

1. Always write meaningful commit messages
2. Keep workflows modular and focused
3. Use appropriate triggers for each workflow
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Monitor workflow execution times
6. Regular maintenance of workflow configurations

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the workflow run logs in the Actions tab
2. Verify all required secrets are configured
3. Ensure branch protections are properly set up
4. Validate workflow syntax using GitHub's built-in validator
